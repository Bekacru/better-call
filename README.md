# Better Call

A tiny TypeScript web framework that lets you create endpoints that can be called like regular functions, while also serving as REST API endpoints. It comes with a very fast router [rou3](https://github.com/unjs/rou3), and an RPC client powered by [better-fetch](https://better-fetch.vercel.app) and open API generator (experimental).

## Install

```bash
pnpm i better-call
```
