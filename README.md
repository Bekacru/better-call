# Better Call

A tiny TypeScript web framework that lets you create endpoints that can be called like regular functions, while also serving as REST API endpoints. It comes with a very fast router based on radix tree (rou3)[] compatible with different web servers (Node, Bun, NextJs, SvelteKit...), and an RPC client that ensures type-safe endpoint invocations.
